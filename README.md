# Operater-Precedence-Parser-in-java
The advantage of this method, is its simplicity of implementation, because in this method we consider all the terminals as operators. we have three precedences: if a&lt;.b: the precedence of the terminal a is less than the precedence of terminal b if a=b: the precedence of both terminals are equal. if a.>b: the precedence of the terminal a is more than the precedence of terminal b  In this project, you can enter an input as below to see the result of the parse: (n+n)*n+n+n$ n+n$ (nn)+nn$ Any other expression containing n with the operators + and * with a $ sign at the end. The project will generate a parse table for inputs of defferent files with the help of firstterm and lastterm functions. The project will generate the parsing result in a three column table; and tells you if the parse failed or was successful.
